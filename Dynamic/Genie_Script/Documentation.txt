I have updated the analysis script so that output the cummalitive sum for both shootings and homicides to
accept a letter, either h or s, that indicates whether the data to be analyzed is shootings vs. homicides.

To analyze shootings data:
--------------------------
--> From website
type: python genie_script.py PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSV_FILE s

--> From a .csv file
type: python genie_script.py -i PATH_TO_INPUT_CSV_FILE PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSV_FILE s

Both ways should ouput a .csv file with the cummalitive sum of shootings per year. The output
data is used to plot the line chart in http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/ct-shooting-victims-map-charts-htmlstory.html

To analyze homicide data:
------------------------
--> From website
type: python genie_script.py PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSV_FILE h

--> From a .csv file
type: python genie_script.py -i PATH_TO_INPUT_CSV_FILE PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSV_FILE h

Both ways should ouput the following:
===> .csv file with the cummalitive sum of homicides per year (for plotting)
===> .csv file with the number of homicides grouped by community name
===> .csv file with the number of homicides grouped by neighborhood name

In addition, the python shell outputs the following:
===> overall number of homicides' victims grouped by sex
===> averge number of homicides' victims per year grouped by sex 
===> overall number of homicides' victims per year groupbed by sex
===> most common causes of death in homicides over the years (answers JB question: How victims died?)


To-do list:
1- For the homicides data analysis:
-----> Demographics of victims: add age and race
-----> when homicides occur? (Month, Day, and Time)

2- Add geo-coding scripts
